**Note:** I did my best to match the app's appearance with the provided images. However, I didn't have access to the original Figma file, so some aspects might not be pixel-perfect in comparison to the design.

## Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Vue 3](https://vuejs.org/) - JS framework
- [Astro](https://astro.build/) - Web framework

## What I learned

- **Working with Astro:** I gained experience in developing with the Astro static site generator.
- **Working with Vue and Building Components:** I learned how to work with Vue.js and create dynamic components for my project.
- **Using CSS Custom Variables:** I explored the use of CSS custom variables (CSS variables) to enhance styling and theming in my project.
- **Using CSS Grid:** I ventured into working with CSS Grid for layout, a shift from my usual use of Flexbox.

## Continued development

- **Implement Drag and Drop Feature:** I did not add a drag and drop feature since it wasn't a requirement, but I might consider adding it in the future.
- **Cross-Browser Testing:** Test the application on a variety of browsers to ensure it works well on different platforms. I only tested it on Microsoft Edge.
- **Polyfills:** Consider adding polyfills for CSS Grid, Flexbox, and custom variables to enhance compatibility with older browsers.
